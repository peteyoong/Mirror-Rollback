# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

  Build "Project Mirror" - a mobile-first reflective AI app that helps users explore self-understanding
  through multiple lenses (Astrology, Human Design, Numerology). The app should include:
  - Onboarding with birth data collection
  - Session persistence (restore user on reload)
  - Lenses screens with personalized chart data
  - Journal with template-based "Reflect with Mirror" feature
  - NEW: LLM-powered Mirror Chat as the primary AI companion

          BUG #1 FIX COMPLETE: Auto-migration for old/incomplete astrology charts.
          - check_and_migrate_astrology_chart() function detects: legacy_string_format, missing_houses, missing_ascendant, incomplete_houses, empty_astrology
          - Integrated into /astrology/summary, /astrology/today, /astrology/deep-dive endpoints
          - IANA timezone support with historical offset resolution (pytz)
          - Birth time normalization (handles "1:25am", "01:25", "13:25")
          - Migration info persisted with audit trail
          - Tested with user 69819f1a1e4549392d7cb6d1 - auto-migrated from legacy_string_format successfully
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"

          COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETE - ALL SCENARIOS PASSED (5/5):
          ✅ Migrated User (69819f1a1e4549392d7cb6d1): Returns success=true, ascendant="Cancer" (not "Unknown"), data_format="full_computed", houses_computed=true
          ✅ Missing Timezone User (6971cc4381beab3a8955b256): Returns success=false with error="MIGRATION_FAILED" as expected
          ✅ Complete User (6971c81f2b40fd5ef501d375): Returns success=true with all core placements (Sun=Pisces, Moon=Aries, Ascendant=Sagittarius)
          ✅ Summary Endpoint Auto-Migration: /api/astrology/summary/69819f1a1e4549392d7cb6d1 returns valid JSON structure
          ✅ Today Endpoint Auto-Migration: /api/astrology/today/69819f1a1e4549392d7cb6d1 returns valid JSON with correct date (2026-02-03)
          
          Backend logs confirm migration activity: "Auto-migrating chart for user 69819f1a1e4549392d7cb6d1, reason: legacy_string_format" and "Successfully migrated chart"
          All astrology endpoints properly trigger auto-migration when needed. Migration persists with audit trail. Error handling works correctly for users with missing data.

      BUG #1 FIX COMPLETE: Astrology Auto-Migration implemented.
      
      What was done:
      1. Integrated check_and_migrate_astrology_chart() into all 3 astrology endpoints
      2. Auto-migration triggers on: legacy_string_format, missing_houses, missing_ascendant, incomplete_houses
      3. IANA timezone support with historical offset resolution (pytz)
      4. Birth time normalization (handles "1:25am", "01:25" formats)
      5. Migration info persisted with audit trail
      
      Test user created: 69819f1a1e4549392d7cb6d1 (Migration Test User)
      - Started with old-format chart (legacy strings)
      - Auto-migrated to full computed chart with houses, planets, ascendant
      
      Test endpoints:
      - GET /api/astrology/deep-dive/69819f1a1e4549392d7cb6d1 (migrated user - should return success:true)
      - GET /api/astrology/deep-dive/6971cc4381beab3a8955b256 (user missing timezone - should return success:false)
      - GET /api/astrology/deep-dive/6971c81f2b40fd5ef501d375 (complete user - should return success:true)
      
      Please test the "Astrology Auto-Migration" task to verify all scenarios work correctly.
